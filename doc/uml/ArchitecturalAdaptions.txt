Controllers (Diagram vs Reality):

UsersController → Actually IdentityController
AuthController → Does NOT exist (authentication is in IdentityController)
DecksController → Actually DeckController
CardsController → Actually CardController
ProgressController → Actually exists but routes to LearningService
TestController → Missing from diagram
Services (Diagram vs Reality):

UserService → Does NOT exist (handled via ASP.NET Identity)
Deck Service (BL) → Actually DeckService
Card Service (BL) → Actually CardService
Progress Service (BL) → Actually LearningService
Learning Algorithm → Integrated into LearningService (not separate)
Data Access Layer:

Repository Layer → Does NOT exist! Services use CoreContext directly
Entity Framework Core (DbContext) → Exists as CoreContext
Database:

SQLite → Actually PostgreSQL (Npgsql)
AspNetUsers Table → Actually identity.Users
Authentication:

JWT Authentication → Actually Cookie-based authentication

Discrepancies Between Diagram and Actual Frontend Implementation:
Components (Diagram vs Reality):

Home Component → Actually class Home
Deck Page Component → Actually class DeckPage
Create Deck Component → Actually class CreateNewDeckPage
Statistics Component → Actually class StatisticsPage
Card Learning Component → Does NOT exist! No card learning component found
LoginPage → Missing from diagram (important for auth flow)
Services (Diagram vs Reality):

Learning Service → Does NOT exist in frontend (no learning/progress service)
Deck Service / Card Service → These are auto-generated API services from OpenAPI, not custom services
Auth Service → Exists (wraps IdentityService from generated API)
UI Framework:

Angular Material → Used
Routing Module → Uses standalone routes with lazy loading
@ngx-translate → Translation library used but not in diagram
AuthGuard → Route guard for protected pages
API Layer (New discovery):

The frontend has an auto-generated API library at projects/api with:
IdentityService (generated)
DeckService (generated)
CardService (generated)
TestService (generated)
